            "Public, Private, Hybrid",
            "IaaS, PaaS, SaaS",
            "AWS, Azure, GCP",
            "Development, Testing, Production"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The three service models are: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), each offering different levels of abstraction."

          "question": "What is the main advantage of cloud computing's elasticity?",
          "options": [
            "Lower costs only",
            "Automatic scaling of resources based on demand",
            "Better security",
            "Faster internet speeds"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Elasticity allows cloud resources to automatically scale up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance while minimizing costs by paying only for what you use."

          "id": "cloud_003",
          "question": "What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?",
          "options": [
            "Horizontal adds more machines, vertical adds more power to existing machines",
            "Vertical is always better than horizontal",
            "Horizontal scaling is only for databases",
            "There is no difference"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "Horizontal scaling (scale out) adds more servers to handle load, while vertical scaling (scale up) increases the power (CPU, RAM) of existing servers."

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that cache and deliver content from locations closer to users, reducing latency and improving performance."

            "Computing without any servers",
            "A model where cloud providers manage infrastructure and you only pay for execution time",

            "A type of database service"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Serverless computing lets developers run code without managing servers. The cloud provider handles infrastructure, and you pay only for actual execution time and resources used."

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable files, enabling version control, automation, and consistent deployments."

            "A cloud storage pattern"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Microservices architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs, enabling better scalability and maintainability."
