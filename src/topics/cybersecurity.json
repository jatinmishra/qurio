          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "The CIA triad consists of Confidentiality (protecting data from unauthorized access), Integrity (ensuring data accuracy), and Availability (ensuring data is accessible when needed)."

            "They are the same thing",
            "Authentication verifies identity, authorization determines permissions",

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Authentication verifies who you are (identity verification), while authorization determines what you're allowed to do (permission checking) after authentication."
